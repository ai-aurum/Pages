## Introduction
My name is Aldrin Ilagan and I am a third-year student at the *University of California San Diego*. I began programming in my senior year of high school, cultivating my programming skills at *Palomar College* until transferring to my current university.

One of my favorite quotes:
>*"What is grief, if not love persevering?" - Vision*
